## Callbacks discord-rpc
It's possible define some signals to discord-rpc events, when the discord-rpc callbacks are called a signal will be emitted, the signals are:

| signal        | arguments                              |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| ready         | **dict** user                          |
| disconnected  | **int** error_code, **string** message |
| error         | **int** error_code, **string** message |
| join_game     | **string** secret                      |
| join_request  | **dict** request                       |
| spectate_game | **string** secret                      |

**ready** and **join_request** receives a **dict** with following keys:

| key           | description                       |
| ------------- | --------------------------------- |
| user_id       | id of player's discord account    |
| username      |                                   |
| discriminator | discord discriminator (e.g 2077)  |
| avatar        | avatar's hash                     |

OBS., I tried only the events **ready** and **error**, I believe the others works too.
